# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction Objectives

1- Determine the most essential features that are linked with mortality due to heart failure.

2- Develop Mortality Prediction Models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 

3- Explore whether gender impacts the importance of different features and the performance of the mortality prediction models.

# Conclusion:

After applying Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest methods and analyzing the dataset based on the objectives, the project ended up with the mortality prediction model using Random Forest, which:

•	Is 85.6% accurate in classifying the patients as dead or survived (Accuracy Score of 0.856)

•	Predicted 80.8% correctly for predicting mortality (Recall Score of 0.808)

•	Out of all mortality predictions, 72.4% is truly mortality (Precision Score of 0.724)

•	is performing 89.6% well (ROC AUC Score of 0.896)


# Final summary: 

Final Summary: 

Doctors can use the Random Forest mortality prediction model for their patients to help them by:

-       Increasing/improvingejection_fraction, 
-       reducing the level of creatinine_phosphokinaseand serume_creatinine
-       increasing serum_sodiumlevel
-       normalize platelets
-       asked smoked women patients to quit smoking as 75% of smoked women (4 out of 3) died.
-       start treatments to normalize the level of the above factors as soon as possible to survive their    patients (as the follow-up period is the most negatively correlated feature).
